**This is a step-by-step guide to the contest tasks.**


## 1. Setup Delete any existing forks of the repository you have on your account

To delete the fork directory and all of the files it contains, we will use the following command:
```
rm -r lab7
```
This command removes all of the files in the directory and the directory itself. We can delete them all in one go using the -r modifier, denoting recursive action.

Keys Pressed:
```
rm -r lab7 <Enter>
```


## 2. Setup Fork the repository

**We will need to go onto github and create a fork. This is achieved by clicking the fork button on the main repo:**

**Then, click Create Fork:**

**Congrats! You just forked the repo.**

Keys Pressed:
```

```

We fork repositories when we want to a copy of a repository owned by someone else to your account. The primary purpose of forking is to allow users to work on a project without affecting the original source code.
 
## 3. The real deal Start the timer!
